Write a main application called Project1.java, and a GUI (that extends JFrame) called 
RomanNumeralGUI.java. The main program should open a file called “input.txt” which will contain 
Roman numerals. There may be more than one Roman numeral on a line, and they will be separated 
by commas.

The GUI should have a grid layout of one row and two columns (column 0 and 1). Column 0 should 
contain each individual Roman numeral from the file. Column 1 should have corresponding lines that 
give the Arabic value of the Roman numeral. For example, if the input file contains
IX
MMXXIII,VII

Then the content pane of the GUI should contain
IX              9
MMXXIII         2023
VII             7
