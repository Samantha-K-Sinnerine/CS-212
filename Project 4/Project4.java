/**
 * This project allows the user to select a file containing Roman Numerals, converts each Numeral to its Arabic value equivalent
 * and stores these in sorted order as a key/value pairs in a TreeMap.
 * The keys and values are diplayed in their respective columns in a GUI.
 * This GUI has the same funtionalities of Project3.java, that is, a menu bar consisting of 2 menus: "File" and "Convert".
 * By clicking on "Open", the File menu allows the user to open an input file containing Roman numerals and display them along with
 * their Arabic values in sorted and unsorted order in the GUI. The "Quit" item allows the user to terminate the program.
 * Additionally, the "Roman to Arabic" menu item under "Convert" allows the user to enter a Roman numeral. If valid, the
 * Arabic value equivalent is displayed in a dialog box.
