This project allows the user to select a file containing Roman Numerals, converts each Numeral to its Arabic value equivalent
and stores these in sorted order as a key/value pairs in a TreeMap.
The keys and values are diplayed in their respective columns in a GUI.

This GUI has the same funtionalities of Project3.java, that is, a menu bar consisting of 2 menus: "File" and "Convert".

By clicking on "Open", the File menu allows the user to open an input file containing Roman numerals and display them along with
their Arabic values in sorted and unsorted order in the GUI. The "Quit" item allows the user to terminate the program.

Additionally, the "Roman to Arabic" menu item under "Convert" allows the user to enter a Roman numeral. If valid, the
Arabic value equivalent is displayed in a dialog box.
