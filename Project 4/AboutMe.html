Use a HashMap for getting individual Roman numeral Arabic values
If you havenâ€™t already done so, use a HashMap to get the Arabic value of a given Roman numeral 
character. See the example code given on Project 1.

Use a TreeMap to sort the Roman numerals
Modify the GUI to again show two columns, one with the Roman numerals and the other with the Arabic 
values. They should appear in sorted order, using the TreeMap to do the sorting. Remember that you 
will need to write a Comparrator object as shown in lecture to inform the TreeMap on how Roman 
numerals are compared.
