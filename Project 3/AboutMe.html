This project displays a GUI with a menu bar consisting of 2 menus.

By clicking on "Open", the File menu allows the user to open an input file containing Roman numerals and display them along with
their Arabic values in sorted and unsorted order in the GUI. The "Quit" item allows the user to terminate the program.

Additionally, the "Roman to Arabic" menu item under "Convert" allows the user to enter a Roman numeral and displays the Arabic value equivalent in a dialog box.

The program validates each RomanNumeral using a try/catch block and prints illegal Roman Numerals to the console.
